    arm64: kvm: Change vgic resource size error to info
    
    A new check was added to upstream to ensure a full
    kernel page was allocated to the vgic.  The check failed
    kvm configuration if the condition wasn't met.
    This 'feature' has been around and there isn't a security
    issue in Acadia.  Change error to info & continue configuration
    for now.
    A future patch using ACPI &/or a DT update will make this patch
    go away in a future snap release.
