Subject: [PATCH] redhat: Replace hardware.redhat.com link in Unsupported
 message

Resending ... did not get any reviews.

P.

---8<---

Bugzilla: http://bugzilla.redhat.com/1810301
Brew: https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/taskinfo?taskID=27902812
Local Tree: git://git.engineering.redhat.com/users/prarit/rhel8 1810301

Upstream Status: RHEL only

For almost a decade, RHEL kernels have output the message

"this hardware has not undergone testing by Red Hat and might not be
certified. Please consult https://hardware.redhat.com for certified
hardware."

for unsupported hardware.  This link should be now be updated to the
new catalog.redhat.com location.  The old hardware.redhat.com is now
redirecting to catalog.redhat.com for older releases.
