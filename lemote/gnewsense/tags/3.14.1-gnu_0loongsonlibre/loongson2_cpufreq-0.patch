Subject: cpufreq: loongson2_cpufreq: don't declare local variable as static
Date: Wed,  2 Apr 2014 10:14:24 +0530

Earlier commit:
	commit 652ed95d5fa6074b3c4ea245deb0691f1acb6656

	    cpufreq: introduce cpufreq_generic_get() routine

did some changes to driver and by mistake made cpuclk as a 'static' local
variable, which wasn't actually required. Fix it.
