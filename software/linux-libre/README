This is a project to release 100% Free Software kernels for Fedora.

It follows the practice established by a number of 100% Free GNU/Linux
distributions: removing non-Free bits from Linux kernels distributed
by third parties.

The removal has so far been accomplished with the script
deblob-2.6.24, inspired in gNewSense's scripts but customized for
BLAG's kernel by Jeff Moe.

I've written deblob-check, a script that you can use to test whether a
kernel source file, a patch or a tarball contains any remaining or
suspicious firmware blob.  It's under heavy development ATM.

In http://www.fsfla.org/svn/fsfla/software/linux-libre/, you'll find:

README: This file, possibly updated.
deblob-2.6.24: Jeff Moe's script, with a patchfile moved inline.
deblob-check: The script I wrote to locate and clean up blobs.

In http://www.lsd.ic.unicamp.br/~oliva/snapshots/linux-libre/, you'll
yum repositories with 100% Free kernel sources and binaries:

F-8/: Free kernels based on Fedora updates/8 (stable releases).
F-8-testing/: Free kernels based on updates/testing/8.
F-8-detesting/: Free builds based on Fedora CVS.
devel/: Free builds based on Fedora development (rawhide).
deltas/: CVS, patches and deltas to re-create the build trees.

Enjoy your freedom!
