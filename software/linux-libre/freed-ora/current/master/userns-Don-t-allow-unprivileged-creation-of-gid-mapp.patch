Subject: [PATCH] userns: Don't allow unprivileged creation of gid mappings

As any gid mapping will allow and must allow for backwards
compatibility dropping groups don't allow any gid mappings to be
established without CAP_SETGID in the parent user namespace.

For a small class of applications this change breaks userspace
and removes useful functionality.  This small class of applications
includes tools/testing/selftests/mount/unprivilged-remount-test.c

Most of the removed functionality will be added back with the addition
of a one way knob to disable setgroups.  Once setgroups is disabled
setting the gid_map becomes as safe as setting the uid_map.

For more common applications that set the uid_map and the gid_map
with privilege this change will have no affect.

This is part of a fix for CVE-2014-8989.
